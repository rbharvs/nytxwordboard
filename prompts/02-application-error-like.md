# Testing with Partial Matching in Python

## Question

Reason I ask is cause I think the isinstance calls in the tests are ugly

## Answer

Okay, absolutely! Given your project structure with Pydantic models and structured error types (`ApplicationError`, `ErrorCode`, etc.), using `match` in your tests is a *very* good idea to make them more readable and robust compared to chaining `isinstance` and attribute checks.

You're right, chains like `assert isinstance(result, NotFoundStorageError) and result.details.resource_type == 'user'` can get cumbersome. `match` offers a much more expressive way to assert the *structure* and *content* of your objects.

While you still can't put `match` *directly inside* `assert`, here are the best ways to leverage `match` for cleaner assertions in your specific context:

**1. Exact Match using Pydantic's `==` (Often the Cleanest)**

If you expect the *exact* error object, including all its fields (or relying on defaults), Pydantic's built-in equality comparison is often the simplest and most readable:

```python
import pytest
from datetime import datetime
from app.core.error import (
    NotFoundStorageError,
    InternalStorageError,
    NotFoundDetails,
    ErrorCode,
    StorageOperationDetails, # Assuming this might be used in InternalStorageError
)

# --- Mock function producing an error ---
def simulate_storage_lookup(resource_id: str, service_name: str):
    if resource_id == "user-123":
        # Simulate finding something (not shown in test)
        pass
    elif resource_id == "product-456":
        # Simulate not found
        return NotFoundStorageError(
            details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type="product", resource_id="product-456"),
            service_name=service_name,
            # timestamp_utc is auto-generated
        )
    else:
        # Simulate internal error
        return InternalStorageError(
             details=StorageOperationDetails( # Example details
                 operation="lookup",
                 resource_type="unknown",
                 raw_error="database connection failed"
             ),
             service_name=service_name
        )
# --- Tests ---

def test_storage_lookup_not_found_exact():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("product-456", "inventory-service")

    # Expected object (timestamp will differ, so we handle it)
    expected = NotFoundStorageError(
        details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type="product", resource_id="product-456"),
        service_name="inventory-service",
    )

    # Assert most fields match, ignore timestamp for simplicity here
    # Or use pytest.approx for datetimes if needed: pytest.approx(datetime.now(timezone.utc), abs=timedelta(seconds=5))
    assert isinstance(result, NotFoundStorageError)
    assert result.code == expected.code
    assert result.message == expected.message # Compares default message
    assert result.details == expected.details
    assert result.service_name == expected.service_name
    assert isinstance(result.timestamp_utc, datetime) # Just check type

    # OR, if you can control/mock the timestamp or don't care about exact match:
    # Create the expected object *exactly* as you think it should be returned
    # expected_exact = NotFoundStorageError(...)
    # assert result == expected_exact # Only works if ALL fields match exactly

def test_storage_lookup_internal_exact():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("other-id", "order-service")

    expected_details = StorageOperationDetails(
         operation="lookup",
         resource_type="unknown",
         raw_error="database connection failed"
     )
    expected = InternalStorageError(details=expected_details, service_name="order-service")

    assert isinstance(result, InternalStorageError)
    assert result.code == expected.code
    assert result.message == expected.message
    assert result.details == expected.details
    assert result.service_name == expected.service_name
    assert isinstance(result.timestamp_utc, datetime)
```

*   **Pros:** Very clean when you expect a specific instance. Leverages Pydantic's features.
*   **Cons:** Requires constructing the full expected object. Can be tricky with auto-generated fields like timestamps unless you specifically exclude them from the comparison or use approximations (`pytest.approx`).

**2. Helper Function with `match` (Excellent for Structural Assertions)**

This is likely the best fit for replacing complex `isinstance`/attribute chains when you don't need an exact object match but want to verify the *structure* and *key values*.

```python
import pytest
from app.core.error import (
    ApplicationError, # Use the base class if matching different error types
    NotFoundStorageError,
    InternalStorageError,
    InvalidArgumentStorageError,
    NotFoundDetails,
    StorageOperationDetails,
    ErrorCode,
)
from datetime import datetime

# --- Mock function (same as before) ---
def simulate_storage_lookup(resource_id: str, service_name: str):
    if resource_id == "user-123": return None # Simulate success
    elif resource_id == "product-456":
        return NotFoundStorageError(details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type="product", resource_id="product-456"), service_name=service_name)
    elif resource_id == "":
         return InvalidArgumentStorageError(details=StorageOperationDetails(operation="lookup", resource_type="any", raw_error="empty id"), service_name=service_name)
    else:
        return InternalStorageError(details=StorageOperationDetails(operation="lookup", resource_type="unknown", raw_error="db error"), service_name=service_name)

# --- Helper Function ---
def is_not_found_error(
    err: ApplicationError | None,
    expected_resource_type: str | None = None,
    expected_resource_id: str | None = None,
    expected_service: str | None = None,
) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(err, ApplicationError): return False # Guard against None or other types

    match err:
        case NotFoundStorageError(
            code=ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND, # Optional: be explicit if needed
            details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type=rt, resource_id=rid),
            service_name=s_name
        ) if (expected_resource_type is None or rt == expected_resource_type) and \
             (expected_resource_id is None or rid == expected_resource_id) and \
             (expected_service is None or s_name == expected_service):
             return True
        case _:
            return False

def is_storage_error_with_code(
    err: ApplicationError | None,
    expected_code: ErrorCode,
    expected_service: str | None = None
) -> bool:
     if not isinstance(err, ApplicationError): return False

     match err:
        case ApplicationError(code=c, service_name=sn) if c == expected_code and \
            (expected_service is None or sn == expected_service):
            return True
        case _:
            return False

# --- Tests using the Helper ---

def test_storage_lookup_not_found_helper():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("product-456", "inventory-service")
    assert is_not_found_error(
        result,
        expected_resource_type="product",
        expected_resource_id="product-456",
        expected_service="inventory-service"
    ), f"Expected NotFoundError for product/product-456, got {result}"

    assert not is_not_found_error(result, expected_resource_type="user"), "Should not match wrong resource type"

def test_storage_lookup_internal_helper():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("other-id", "order-service")
    # Example: Just check the code and service
    assert is_storage_error_with_code(
        result,
        expected_code=ErrorCode.INTERNAL,
        expected_service="order-service"
    ), f"Expected Internal error from order-service, got {result}"

    assert not is_storage_error_with_code(result, ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND), "Should not be NotFound"

def test_storage_lookup_invalid_arg_helper():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("", "user-service")
    assert is_storage_error_with_code(
        result,
        expected_code=ErrorCode.INVALID_ARGUMENT,
        expected_service="user-service"
    ), f"Expected InvalidArgument from user-service, got {result}"
```

*   **Pros:** Keeps assertion lines clean (`assert helper(...)`). Very readable pattern logic within the helper. Handles complex structures, specific attribute checks, and guards gracefully. Reusable logic. Directly addresses the "ugly `isinstance`" problem.
*   **Cons:** Requires writing helper functions.

**3. Direct `match` with Flag (Good for In-Test Readability)**

If the pattern isn't complex enough to warrant a separate helper function, but too complex for a simple `==` or inline check:

```python
import pytest
from app.core.error import (
    NotFoundStorageError, InternalStorageError, NotFoundDetails, ErrorCode
)
from datetime import datetime

# --- Mock function (same as before) ---
def simulate_storage_lookup(resource_id: str, service_name: str):
    # ... (implementation as before) ...
    if resource_id == "product-456":
        return NotFoundStorageError(details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type="product", resource_id="product-456"), service_name=service_name)
    else:
        return InternalStorageError(details="Some details", service_name=service_name) # Simplified details

def test_storage_lookup_not_found_direct_match():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("product-456", "inventory-service")
    matched = False
    match result:
        # Match specific type, code, and parts of details
        case NotFoundStorageError(
            code=ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND,
            details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type="product", resource_id="product-456"),
            service_name="inventory-service"
            # timestamp_utc=_ # Ignore timestamp
        ):
            matched = True
        case _:
             pytest.fail(f"Result {result} did not match the expected NotFound pattern.") # Optional: fail fast

    assert matched, f"Result {result} did not match the expected NotFound pattern." # Final assert

def test_storage_lookup_any_internal_error_direct_match():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("other-id", "order-service")
    is_internal = False
    match result:
        # Just check it's an InternalStorageError from the correct service
        case InternalStorageError(service_name="order-service"):
            is_internal = True

    assert is_internal, f"Expected InternalStorageError from order-service, got {result}"
```

*   **Pros:** Keeps the pattern logic directly visible within the test. Uses `match` syntax explicitly.
*   **Cons:** More verbose than the helper method within the test function itself (multiple lines). Introduces a flag variable.

**Conclusion for Your Project:**

*   For asserting an *exact* error object (if feasible with defaults/timestamps), use Pydantic's `==` (Method 1 variation).
*   For asserting that an object *matches a specific structure* or has certain key properties (like `code == ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND` and `details` is a `NotFoundDetails` with a specific `resource_type`), the **Helper Function (Method 2)** is highly recommended. It leads to very clean `assert helper(...)` lines in your tests and encapsulates the matching logic nicely.
*   The **Direct Match with Flag (Method 3)** is also a good option if you prefer seeing the pattern directly in the test, especially for moderately complex patterns.

All these are significantly cleaner and more intention-revealing than long `isinstance` and `getattr` chains when dealing with your structured Pydantic models and enums. The helper function approach probably provides the best balance of power and test readability for complex cases.

## Question

What about a hamcrest/Catch2 style matcher? Is that too non-pythonic?

## Answer

Okay, that's a great question about testing philosophy and style in Python!

Using a Hamcrest-style (or Catch2-style) matcher library *is* possible in Python, but whether it's considered "too non-pythonic" is subjective and depends heavily on team preference and the specific context.

**The Hamcrest/Catch2 Style:**

These libraries typically provide:

1.  **Matcher Objects:** Objects that represent specific conditions (e.g., `equal_to`, `has_property`, `contains_string`, `is_instance_of`, `greater_than`).
2.  **Composability:** Matchers can often be combined (e.g., `all_of(matcher1, matcher2)`, `any_of(...)`, `not_(...)`).
3.  **Assertion Function:** A function like `assert_that(actual_value, matcher_expression)`.
4.  **Detailed Failure Messages:** A key benefit is that the matchers themselves often generate very descriptive error messages when an assertion fails, explaining precisely *what* was expected and *what* was found.

**Python Equivalent: PyHamcrest**

The most direct equivalent in Python is the `PyHamcrest` library.

```python
# Example using PyHamcrest (you'd need to pip install PyHamcrest)
from hamcrest import assert_that, equal_to, has_properties, instance_of, contains_string, is_not, none

from app.core.error import NotFoundStorageError, NotFoundDetails, ErrorCode

# --- Mock function (same as before) ---
def simulate_storage_lookup(resource_id: str, service_name: str):
     if resource_id == "product-456":
        return NotFoundStorageError(details=NotFoundDetails(resource_type="product", resource_id="product-456"), service_name=service_name)
     else:
        return None # Simulate success or other errors

def test_storage_lookup_not_found_hamcrest():
    result = simulate_storage_lookup("product-456", "inventory-service")

    assert_that(result, instance_of(NotFoundStorageError)) # Basic type check

    # More detailed check combining multiple matchers
    assert_that(result, has_properties(
        'code', equal_to(ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND),
        'service_name', equal_to("inventory-service"),
        'message', contains_string("not found"), # Partial string match
        'details', has_properties(
            'resource_type', equal_to("product"),
            'resource_id', equal_to("product-456")
        )
        # timestamp_utc can be ignored or checked with instance_of(datetime)
    ))

def test_storage_lookup_success_hamcrest():
     result = simulate_storage_lookup("user-123", "auth-service")
     # Asserting something is None or not a specific type
     assert_that(result, is_not(instance_of(NotFoundStorageError)))
     assert_that(result, none()) # Check if it's exactly None
```

**Is it "Pythonic"? Arguments For and Against:**

*   **Arguments For (Why it can be good):**
    *   **Readability (Subjective):** For complex assertions involving multiple conditions or nested structures, `assert_that(obj, has_properties(...))` can arguably read more like natural language than chained `assert` statements or complex boolean expressions.
    *   **Excellent Failure Messages:** This is often the strongest argument. PyHamcrest matchers generate very specific and helpful messages telling you exactly which part of the complex assertion failed. This can be significantly better than a generic `AssertionError` from `assert a.b.c == x`.
    *   **Composability:** The ability to combine matchers (`all_of`, `any_of`, `not_`) provides powerful logical constructs for assertions.
    *   **Extensibility:** You can write your own custom matchers.

*   **Arguments Against (Why it might feel "non-pythonic"):**
    *   **Verbosity:** For simple checks, `assert_that(x, equal_to(5))` is more verbose than `assert x == 5`.
    *   **External Dependency:** It requires adding and learning another library (`PyHamcrest`), whereas `assert` is built-in.
    *   **Style Deviation:** The dominant style in the Python ecosystem, especially with `pytest`, leans heavily on the standard `assert` statement. `pytest` does significant magic (assertion rewriting/introspection) to provide detailed failure messages for standard comparisons (`assert dict1 == dict2`, `assert list1 == list2`), which PyHamcrest bypasses.
    *   **Abstraction Layer:** It introduces a layer of matcher objects rather than directly evaluating Python expressions within the `assert` statement, which some might see as less direct.
    *   **Less Common:** It's not as widely used as standard `assert` in the Python world, so new team members might be unfamiliar with it.

**Comparison with `match`:**

*   `match` is now built-in (3.10+) and specifically designed for structural pattern matching in Python. Using it (via helpers or flags) feels increasingly "Pythonic".
*   `match` focuses on checking if a value conforms to *one* specific pattern structure.
*   Hamcrest focuses on composing potentially multiple logical conditions about a value.
*   Hamcrest typically provides better automatic failure messages out-of-the-box compared to a raw `match` statement within a test.

**Conclusion:**

Hamcrest-style matchers (like PyHamcrest) are **not inherently "wrong"** in Python, and they offer real benefits, particularly in **readability for complex assertions** and **detailed failure messages**.

However, they are **less idiomatic** than using the standard `assert` statement, especially when combined with `pytest`'s assertion introspection. The Python community generally favors leveraging built-in syntax and standard library features where possible.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Default to Standard `assert`:** For most cases, especially with `pytest`, stick to `assert expression`. `pytest` provides good output for common comparisons.
2.  **Use `match` Helpers/Flags:** For asserting complex *structures* (like your Pydantic models and errors), using `match` via helper functions or flags (as discussed previously) is a very good, modern, and increasingly Pythonic approach.
3.  **Consider PyHamcrest (or similar) Sparingly:** If you have *very* complex validation logic within a single assertion, or if your team strongly prefers the Hamcrest style and finds its failure messages significantly superior for your specific use cases, then using `PyHamcrest` *can* be justified. Discuss it with your team first to ensure consistency. Avoid using it for simple assertions where `assert x == y` is perfectly clear.

Ultimately, consistency within your project codebase is often the most important factor.

## Question

Idk what pyhamcrest is. I meant like a helper class called (e.g.) ApplicationErrorLike that implements an __eq__ method and then I could do partial matches e.g., assert result.failure() == ApplicationErrorLike(NotFoundStorageError(details=NotFoundDetails(resource_id=user_id, resource_type=foo)). What do you think of that?

## Answer

Okay, I understand perfectly now! You're not talking about importing a library like `PyHamcrest`, but rather creating your *own* helper classes that implement `__eq__` to perform these partial, structural comparisons directly using the standard `assert actual == expected_matcher` syntax.

**Yes, this is a totally valid and potentially quite Pythonic approach!** It leverages Python's data model (`__eq__`) to create domain-specific "matchers".

Let's break down this idea:

**The Concept:**

1.  **Create Matcher Classes:** You define classes like `ApplicationErrorLike`, `NotFoundDetailsLike`, etc.
2.  **`__init__` Stores Expectations:** The `__init__` method of these classes takes arguments for the *specific* attributes you want to check in your assertion (e.g., `code=ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND`, `details_like=NotFoundDetailsLike(resource_type='user')`). It stores these expected values internally. Any argument *not* provided is implicitly ignored during the comparison.
3.  **Custom `__eq__` Logic:** The `__eq__(self, other)` method is the core. It gets called when you do `assert actual_error == ApplicationErrorLike(...)`. Inside `__eq__`:
    *   It checks if `other` (the actual object) is of a compatible type (e.g., `isinstance(other, ApplicationError)` or even the specific type if provided to `__init__`).
    *   For *each* attribute stored in `self` (the matcher instance) during `__init__`, it compares it to the corresponding attribute in `other`.
    *   If `details_like` was provided, it recursively calls `self._expected_details_like == other.details`.
    *   It returns `True` only if the type is compatible *and* all the specified attributes match. It ignores attributes on `other` that weren't specified in the matcher's `__init__`.
4.  **`__repr__` for Clarity:** A good `__repr__` on the matcher class is crucial so that assertion failure messages clearly show *what* the matcher was looking for.

def test_lookup_success_partial_eq():
     result = simulate_storage_lookup("user-123", "auth-svc")
     assert result is None # Standard check for None
```

**Evaluation of this Approach:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Highly Pythonic:** Uses standard operators (`==`) and core language features (`__eq__`, `__repr__`, potentially `dataclasses`).
    *   **Readable Assertions:** `assert actual == Matcher(...)` is very clean at the point of use.
    *   **No External Dependencies:** Keeps your test dependencies minimal.
    *   **Domain-Specific:** Tailored exactly to the structures you need to match (your `ApplicationError` hierarchy).
    *   **Flexible:** You control the exact matching logic (exact value, contains, type check, etc.) within `__eq__`.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Boilerplate:** You need to write and maintain these `XxxLike` matcher classes. This could be tedious if you have many complex objects.
    *   **Failure Message Detail:** This is the *biggest potential downside*. While your custom `__repr__` helps, `pytest`'s standard assertion introspection works best on basic types and direct attribute access. When `assert actual == Matcher(...)` fails, `pytest` might just show you the `repr` of both sides. It likely *won't* automatically tell you *which specific field inside your custom `__eq__` failed* (e.g., "AssertionError: expected code=ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND but was ErrorCode.INTERNAL"). You'd have to debug or add print statements inside `__eq__` to see the exact point of failure. Libraries like PyHamcrest are often designed to provide this level of detail automatically. You *could* build failure reason tracking into your `__eq__` but that adds complexity.
    *   **Discoverability:** A teammate needs to understand what checks `ApplicationErrorLike(...) == actual` performs by looking at its implementation.

**Compared to `match` statement helper:**

*   This custom `__eq__` approach gives you the `assert a == b` syntax.
*   The `match` statement approach keeps the pattern definition very explicit and visual within the helper function or test, potentially making the *pattern itself* easier to read.
*   Failure messages might be slightly easier to customize precisely with `match` by using `pytest.fail("Specific reason...")` within `case` blocks.

**Conclusion:**

Using custom classes with `__eq__` for partial matching is a **very good and Pythonic alternative** to chained asserts or even `match` statement helpers, *especially* if you prioritize the clean `assert actual == Matcher(...)` syntax.

**The main trade-off is the effort of implementation versus the potential lack of highly detailed failure messages out-of-the-box compared to `pytest`'s introspection on simple types or a dedicated library like PyHamcrest.** If you are willing to write the matcher classes and accept that debugging a failure might require looking *inside* the `__eq__` method (or enhancing it to store failure reasons), then this is an excellent approach. Make sure your `__repr__` methods are informative!

## Question

Are the __repr__ functions you have sufficient you think?

## Answer

Yes, I think the `__repr__` functions provided in the example are **sufficient and well-suited** for their purpose in testing with this custom matcher approach.

Here's why:

1.  **Clarity of Intent:** They clearly show the *type* of matcher (`ApplicationErrorLike`, `DetailsLike`) and, crucially, *which specific constraints* were set on that matcher instance for the assertion.
2.  **Shows Only Specified Fields:** They intelligently omit attributes that were left as default/unspecified (using the `object()` sentinel or `None` check). This prevents clutter and focuses the output on what the test *actually cared about* for that specific assertion.
3.  **Uses `repr()` for Values:** Using `!r` (or implicitly calling `repr()` on nested matchers) ensures that string values have quotes, enums are shown clearly, etc., making the output unambiguous.
4.  **Handles Nesting:** `ApplicationErrorLike.__repr__` correctly includes the `repr` of `DetailsLike` if it was provided, showing the nested expectations.
5.  **Informative Failure Messages:** When an `assert actual == Matcher(...)` fails, `pytest` will print:
    ```
    AssertionError: assert <repr of actual object> == <repr of matcher object>
    ```
    Your custom `__repr__` makes the right-hand side (`<repr of matcher object>`) very informative. For example:
    ```
    # If this assertion fails:
    assert result == ApplicationErrorLike(
        expected_type=NotFoundStorageError,
        code=ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND,
        details_like=DetailsLike(resource_type="product")
    )

    # The output might look something like:
    AssertionError: assert InternalStorageError(...) == ApplicationErrorLike(expected_type=NotFoundStorageError, code=<ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND: 'NOT_FOUND'>, details_like=DetailsLike(resource_type='product'))
    ```
    This immediately tells the reader that the matcher was looking for a `NotFoundStorageError` with code `NOT_FOUND` and details having `resource_type='product'`. They can compare that to the `repr` of the actual `InternalStorageError` shown on the left to see the discrepancy (type mismatch, code mismatch, etc.).

**What they *don't* do (and why that's usually okay):**

*   They don't explicitly state *which specific check inside `__eq__` failed*. For example, they don't produce a message like "Assertion failed: expected code=NOT_FOUND but got INTERNAL".
*   Getting that level of detail usually requires either a dedicated assertion library (like PyHamcrest) or more complex logic within `__eq__` to store the failure reason, which adds significant complexity to the matcher itself.

**Conclusion:**

The goal of the `__repr__` here is to clearly represent the *state* and *intended checks* of the matcher object. The
